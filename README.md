### Image-Clustering-in-Numpy-using-K-means
Using K-means clustering algorithm built from scratch in Numpy to segment gray-scale images


Run the FasterKmeans.py for Grayscale Input Images.

Following is the image with original images encoded with 8 bits and a clustered image at 3 bits.


Original 8-bit Grayscale image | Kmeans-based clustered image with 3-bit representation
:---------------------:|:-------------------------:
![](<8bit_cheetah.png>)| ![](<3bit_cheetah.png>)


For colored images, run the kmeans(updated).py

Following is the clustered image at 8 different clusters.

Original 24-bit Color image | Kmeans-based clustered image with roughly 5-bit representation
:---------------------:|:-------------------------:
![](<24bit_scene.png>)| ![](<5bit_scene.png>)
